# GiftCertificare front-end app

This project was created in order to build front-end application for this API: [GiftCertificate secured](https://github.com/YegorChevardin/gift-certificate-secured).

## How to start the project locally?

Prepare `.env` file from the `.env-example` file, that will contain link to `gift-certificate` API application, like in reference above.
Here is the example of env file:
```text
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-custom-link-to-api
```

In the project directory run:
>`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

> `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

>`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
